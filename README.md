#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
  Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods, and tools to develop and maintain high-quality software systems. It involves software product   design, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance.
  It is important in the technology industry because it enables the creation of software applications and systems that power various aspects of modern life, including communication,   commerce, entertainment, and healthcare.



Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering include:
  -early programming: this era fetaures the development of early programming langauges like COBOL and FROTRAN.
  -emergence of software methodologies: this era introduced a sequential approach to software development(waterfall model) and the promotion of reusable and modular code through object-  oriented programming languages such as C++
   -modern sofware engineering: this era came with the rise of AI and machine learning in software dvelopment. starting from 2020, AI tools are increasingly being used for code       generation, testing, and even decision-making within the software development process. we are also experiencing a shift to cloud-based arechitectures and micro-services allowing for   greater scalability and flexibility in software design and deployment. also, with the increasing importance of cybersecurity, practices like DevSecOps have emerged to inegrate security   into every phase of software development. 
  

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
The Software Development Life Cycle involves: 
  gathering requirements: this involves gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements. 
  software product design: ths involves creating high-level and detailed designs of the sofware architecture and user interface.
  implementation: this involves writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.
  testing: at this stage, the product is tested to ensure it meets quality standards and functional reqquirements.
  deployment: at this stage, the sofware is being released to the end users
  maintenance: providing ongoing support, updates and enhancements to the software after deployment.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
  the waterfall methodology involves  a sequential approach with distinct phases flowing down like a waterfall while the agile methodoloogy involves an iterative and incremental approach   focused on flexibility, collaboration and responding to change. the waterfall methodology is commonly used in 


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
  -the responsibilities of a sofware developer includes writng codes and implementing software solutions.
  -a quality assurance engineer ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.
  -a project manager oversees the planning, execution and delivery of software projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
  integrated development environments are software suites that provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging and testing code. examples include: visual studio, eclipse, etc.
  version control systems are software tools for tracking changes to source code and coordnating work amomg team members, eg: git, subversion, etc.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
  some common challenges faced by software engineers are:
    -changing requirements
    -tight deadlines 
    -technical debt
  some strategies to overcome these challenges:
    -effective communication
    -agile methodology
    -prioritization of tasks
    -regular reassessment of project goals and timelines.
  

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
  unit testing involves testing individual components or modules of software
  integration testing involves testing interaction between components of the prodcut
  system testing involves testing the entire software as a whole
  acceptance testing involves testing the product against user requriements to ensure it meets user needs

  the general importance of quality assurance measures such as code reviews, automated testing and continuous integration help identify and fix defects early in the development process leading to higher quality software products.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
  prompt engineering involves creatng effective input prompts for AI models to generate accurate, relevant, and useful outputs. it is crucial when interacting with AI models because it directly influences the quality, relevance and accuracy of the output


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
  vague prompt: tell me about technology

  improved prompt: provide a brief overview of the key advancements in smartphone technology over the past decade.

  the improved prompt is more effective becuase it has given a more accurate query for the information needed
